# Central-Exchange-Liquid-Staking-Tokens

LSTs offer holders unique opportunities to earn staking rewards just by holding the token and the freedom to reuse the token in another capacity.

A lot of light has been shed on DeFi staked SOL tokens, such as jitoSOL, bSOL, jupSOL, mSOL, and bonkSOL, while there has been little to none shed on CEX-backed staked SOL tokens. I want to change that.

This analysis aims to determine whether these tokens have any appeal to traders and investors, as well as their level of appeal.



The user analysis for each CEX LST will follow a form of IDG developed by Flipside Crypto. Knowing how many holders or what platform you can find them is not enough; there's a need to go deeper.

What are holders doing with the token? What strategies are they using to maximise value? Who's responsible for the majority of the flow and trades done?

The user analysis will follow a scoring system from 0 to 4, 0 being the lowest and 4 the highest.

The analysis will cover the last 60 days.

Scoring System

Balance Score: Balance is greater than the average balance of all wallets holding the token ( bal > avg bal ) = 1 point

Activity Score: Used in at least 5 transactions ( txn >= 5 ) = 1 point

Holder Score: Held for more than 30 consecutive days ( hold > 30 days ) = 1 point

Transaction Score: top 95th percentile = 1 point

The points will be added and graded as follows:

4 points = Power User

3 points = Active User

2 points = Regular User

1 point = Casual User

0 points = Inactive User
