# Central-Exchange-Liquid-Staking-Tokens

LSTs offer holders unique opportunities to earn staking rewards just by holding the token and the freedom to reuse the token in another capacity.

A lot of light has been shed on DeFi staked SOL tokens, such as jitoSOL, bSOL, jupSOL, mSOL, and bonkSOL, while there has been little to none shed on CEX-backed staked SOL tokens. I want to change that.

This analysis aims to determine whether these tokens have any appeal to traders and investors, as well as their level of appeal.
